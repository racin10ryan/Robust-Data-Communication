Progress: 	
	- Working control through XMLR-PC

Known Bugs: 		
	- Tx missing length for Protocol Formatter
	

To Do: 
	- Need to find amplifications settings for different Frequencies and Constellations
	  Currently only 915 MHz with BPSK is working to my knowledge. (This is why program
	  always selects this frequency and constellation.
	- Implement packetizer
	- Implement ZMQ
	- Develope and implement decision algorithms (While there is a
	  function that selects frequency and constellation, it will need to be
	  updated to take strings from from the decision ["LOW", "MID", "HIGH]
	  ["BPSK","QPSK","16QAM"]) 
	- Fix Bugs
	- Remove Herobrine
